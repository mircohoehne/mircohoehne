  <summary><h3>Mirco's Coding Journey</h3></summary>

  My journey into tech started during my Industrial Engineering bachelor's, where I took a C/C++ programming course with in-person coding exams. I experimented with Python on my own, and dabbled in IT security out of curiosity.  

  During my master's, a [data science talk (German)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YpwsdRKt8Q) completely shifted my focus. I began taking every university course I could find on statistics and machine learning, alongside specialized online Progams, such as the [*IBM Data Science Specialization*](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science). Afterwards I got the opportunity to do two internships.

  **First internship** â€“ Large German bank: built a proof of concept for a reinforcement learning trading system for the stock and forex markets. This involved implementing market data ingestion, designing the RL environment, and running performance benchmarks.  

  **Second internship** â€“ Major German automotive company: researched dataset reduction techniques for object detection, leveraging coreset selection to improve model efficiency.
  
  After the internships we continued the research and the results led to the **first-authored** paper *Enhancing Data Efficiency for Training Object Detectors*, presented at IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium 2025 ([see above](#-publications)).
