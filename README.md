  <summary><h3>Mirco's Coding Journey</h3></summary>

  <br>
  As part of my bachelors in industrial engineering I took a course on the foundations of Programming, which had Programming exams (in Person) in C and C++. I dabbled in Python and a bit in ITsec. During my Masters I saw a [Talk]() that sparked my interest in Data Science, took an online course and all University courses I could find on stats and Machine Learning. I got my first internship at a large german bank and worked on a proof of concept for a Reinforcement Learning system, that trades on the stock / forex market. I continued taking courses (University as well as online courses), got a second internship at a large german automotive company, where I researched data reduction techniques for object detection datasets using Machine Learning / Deep Learning. The results where presented in a Paper, which was part of the IEEE Intelligent Vehicle Conference 2025 and will be published in the proceedings of the conference on IEEE Xplore. You can check if its already available at https://ieee-itss.org/conf/iv/.
